<p>Loon LLC was an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary working on providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The company used high-altitude balloons in the stratosphere at an altitude of 18 km (11 mi) to 25 km (16 mi) to create an aerial wireless network with up to 1 Mbit/s speeds. A reference to the balloons used, Project Loon began as a research and development project by X (formerly Google X) in 2011, but later spun out into a separate company in July 2018. In January 2021, it was announced that the company would be temporarily discontinued due to lack of profitability</p>

<p>The balloon network was designed for connecting the people, it travels on the edges of space. Through the network of balloons people in rural and remote areas are getting connected . These balloon structures are 15-meters wide and made from polyethylene film.</p>

<p>For this Google explained :<i> “Signals are transmitted through the project loon`s balloons to an specialized Internet antenna mounted at the workplace that use technology of radio frequency”. “The Internet antenna is connected to consumer grade router. Network signals that travel through the balloon are relayed to ground stations, where it’s connected to pre-existing internet infrastructure, like our local telecommunication infrastructure and Fiber optic cables.”</i></p>
